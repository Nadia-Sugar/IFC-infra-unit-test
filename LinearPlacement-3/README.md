### Intent

This scenario allows testing of simple linear placement along an alignment. It places assemblies (of assemblies) so as to test for example the positioning of signalling elements.

### Prerequisites

This scenario builds upon the Alignment semantic and geometry concepts. 

### Content

This scenario covers the following concepts and/or IFC entities:

- IfcAlignment
- IfcAlignmentSegment
- IfcAlignmentHorizontal
- IfcAlignmentHorizontalSegment
- IfcLine
- IfcCircle
- IfcClothoid
- IfcCompositeCurve
- IfcAlignmentVertical
- IfcAlignmentVerticalSegment
- IfcGradientCurve
- IfcLinearPlacement
- IfcAxis2PlacementLinear
- IfcPointByDistanceExpression
