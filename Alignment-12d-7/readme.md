### Intent

This scenario has an alignment with left arc in horizontal and crest and sag parabolas for vertical.

That is, it has 
Civil Horizontal:

- horizontal straight
- horizontal arc with IFC positive radius of curvature
- horizontal straight

Civil Vertical:

- vertical straight
- vertical crest parabola
- vertical straight
- vertical sag parabola
- vertical straight

In the IFC file there is only the IFC semantic definition of the alignment and no IFC geometry.

![alignment12d7](../Alignment-12d-7/Alignment-12d-7.png  "Alignment with Vertial Crest and Sag Parabolas")

The IFC file was generated by 12d Model. 

### Prerequisites

This scenario builds upon the scenarios:

- Alignment-12d-6

### Content

This scenario covers the additional concepts and/or IFC entities:

- `IfcAlignmentVerticalSegment` with `PredefinedType=PARABOLICARC` for crest and sag

### Supporting files

Following files correspond to this scenario:
