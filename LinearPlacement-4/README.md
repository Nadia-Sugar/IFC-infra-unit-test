### Intent

This scenario allows testing of simple linear placement along an alignment. It places assemblies (of assemblies) so as to test for example the positioning of signalling elements. It also uses lateral and vertical offsets.

### Prerequisites

This scenario builds upon the Alignment semantic and geometry concepts. 

### Content

This scenario covers the following concepts and/or IFC entities:

- IfcAlignment
- IfcAlignmentSegment
- IfcAlignmentHorizontal
- IfcAlignmentHorizontalSegment
- IfcLine
- IfcCircle
- IfcClothoid
- IfcCompositeCurve
- IfcAlignmentVertical
- IfcAlignmentVerticalSegment
- IfcGradientCurve
- IfcLinearPlacement
- IfcAxis2PlacementLinear
- IfcPointByDistanceExpression
- IfcElementAssembly
